Designed and implemented a physics system in the game engine PrimeEngine, which included gravity and collisions.
Established oriented collision boxes for each static and dynamic mesh, and employed ray-casting to detect collision objects and angles. The game objects' velocity was updated based on the inelastic collision rules.
Configured NPC behavior to slide along static objects upon collision and fall from cliff edges when venturing outside.
